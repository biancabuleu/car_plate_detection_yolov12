## 📂 Description

This repository contains the annotation files for training a YOLOv12-based system for **automatic license plate detection and recognition**.  
The labels are in YOLO format and were used in conjunction with [PaddleOCR](https://paddlepaddle.github.io/PaddleOCR/v3.0.0/) for end-to-end ALPR tasks.

> **Note:** Due to GitHub file size limits, **images are not included here**.

📥 You can download the **image dataset** from the link below:

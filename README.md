# YOLOv12 License Plate Dataset Labels

This repository contains the **label files** used for training the model in the research paper:

**"A Deep Learning-Based System for Automatic License Plate Recognition Using YOLOv12 and PaddleOCR"**  
by *Bianca Buleu, Raul Robu, and Ioan Filip*.

## Description

The labels provided in this repository correspond to images used to train a YOLOv12-based license plate recognition system. These annotations follow the YOLO format and are intended for use in automatic license plate detection tasks.

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the **image dataset** itself is not included in this repository.

You can download the complete set of training images from the following link:
